# effectproject

Previous version of a current project - based in Qt.

Create effects, connect them together, and stream audio. All this with a simple user-friendly interface.

The "effect-chain" audio streaming system had to be put together from scratch, and using JACK was the only way to reduce latency - but this introduced more issues.

I ended up migrating development to JUCE because of the much more complex audio system. I was unable to merge the two projects so I started from scratch. 
I have been developing the JUCE project full-time since.
